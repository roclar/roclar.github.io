### Sysadmins and Their Role in Cyberwar: Why Several Governments Want to Spy on and Hack You, Even If You Have Nothing to Hide
9:00 am-10:30 am
Keynote Address
Christopher Soghoian, Principal Technologist, American Civil Liberties Union

I explain technology and survalience to lawyers.

"I have nothing to hide" so why up my security?

You are targets, whether you like it or not.

Even if you have nothing to hide, you are still useful.

Governments with budgets in the billions are willing to compromise individuals who themselves have done nothing wrong in order to gain access to information they can get to as a means to an end.

Things you can do as somebody with access to make yourself a harder target:

 - Signal
 - Encrypt by default
 - Penetration resistent OSes such as [Qubes](https://www.qubes-os.org/)
 - The linux kernel team is focused on performance and reliability not as much on security. [The kernel of the argument](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/11/05/net-of-insecurity-the-kernel-of-the-argument/) Microsoft took a lot of heat early on for being insecure but they have greatly advanced their security practices.  Linux needs to increase their kernel level security efforts as well.

OS Level Virtualization - Docker's class of virtualization

Realizing Linux Containers (LXC) - http://www.slideshare.net/BodenRussell/realizing-linux-containerslxc - Hypervisors vs containers

Docker Machine is a client for building Docker hosts.  Doc on installing it at http://docs.docker.com/machine/

Why Docker? Isolation, Lightweight, Simplicity, Workflow, and Community

Docker Client and Daemon of Docker Engine - docker version

Docker images are read only templates used to create containers which are isolated application platforms.

Registry (eg. Docker Hub) contain various repositories for images.

Docker installations are supported on my Linux platforms.  Installation script is available on https://get.docker.com  Note that if you use the default OS repositories you will likely get an older version.

To run docker commands without sudo you just need to add your user to the docker group.

Install Toolbox on Windows and Mac - https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases

docker run does two things.  Creates the container using the image we specify and runs the container.  Has two important flags: -i to connect STDIN on the terminal and -t specifies to get a pseudo-terminal

docker exec is a much cleaner way to attach and detach from a docker container

docker inspect is how you get all of the metadata information for a container
