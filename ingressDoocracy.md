**We are a do-ocracy**

I've borrowed this from somewhere else (source at the bottom) but this basically sums it up- 

A do-ocratic example: 30 people are planning on camping together. Mary asks  “What if we organize a food pool so we can all cook and eat together?” Others answer, “Sure, I’d be a part of that,” or “I can make cake on Friday night.” (Or, often, nobody answers!) Soon, Mary is calling campmates to borrow pots, pans and utensils, posting weekly menus to the mailing list, collating different people’s dietary restrictions, collecting money for food, and organizing trips to the store to buy supplies. At camp, she posts work signup sheets for cooking and cleanup, answers questions, and fills in when others can’t (or don’t) do their shifts.

A new campmate may grumble, “Jeez, why does Mary get to decide what everyone eats and when they work? Who put her in charge?” Older and wiser heads will say, “This is a do-ocracy. If you think you can do Mary’s job, and you want to, then get up there and do it. She’ll probably be relieved. If not, don’t be a jerk and make a big stink about it, or else she’ll stop working so hard and we won’t have anything to eat!”

Do-ocracy typically evolves spontaneously in groups where:

 - **Stakes are low** Typically, if job X or task Y didn’t get done, or got done poorly, it’s not a life-or-death situation.
 - Authority is **non-coercive**
 - **Work is plentiful** There are lots of jobs to do, and lots of people to do them.
 - **Effort is rewarded** with recognition.
 - **Culture of participation** Each member of the community feels a right and a duty to take on responsibilities.

**Dangers in a do-ocracy**
I believe many here have experienced at least one (sometimes all) of these.

 - **Burnout**. People can get too attached to the do-ocratic system and volunteer for too many jobs, or too much work, and tend to have a low TruckFactor?.

 - **Despotism** A person who’s doocrat’d themselves into control of a very necessary system (network, food pool, etc.) can get heady with power and demand rewards or tribute for their work.

 - **Frustration** Some people don’t have the time or means to do something, but they do have (real or imagined) expertise. In a doocracy, they will feel overrun and perceive the situation as slipping out of their hands. This can cause frustration. And remember: “Fear is the path to the dark side…”

 - **Fair Process** Doocracy is not always explicitly defined, so there are diverging perception dangers about “fairness”.
 
 - **Resentment**. If only a minority of participants in the community do-ocratize themselves into the hard jobs, they can resent others who don’t take on responsibility.

 - **The Martyrdom Complex** Some people have a psychological need to work strenuously most of the time, perhaps because they are seeking persecution and suffering, motivated by a desire for penance. In do-ocracy, people with these psychological needs tend to take more responsibility and sometimes make strict rules to impose on others.

 - **Complacency** If a minority of people take on jobs, the others can become complacent and ignore new tasks, since “someone else will do it.”

 - **Social Exclusion** People who can’t do things, or choose not do things, are often marginalized in decision-making, which compounds social divides.
