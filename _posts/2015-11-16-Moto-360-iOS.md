title: Moto 360 iOS
---
I recently acquired a [Moto 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_360). According to the [compatibility check](http://www.android.com/wear/check/), this watch is not officially supported with Android Wear on iOS devices.  I tried connecting the watch to my iPhone with no luck while the watch was running software version 4.4W2.

This [Slashgear article](http://www.slashgear.com/connect-the-moto-360-to-ios-needs-an-android-phone-11383104/) provided some hope that I could get this watch working with my iPhone.  I just needed an Android device to update the software on the watch.

I borrowed a co-worker's Moto X to perform the update.  The phone had to receive the update via Bluetooth and it is not a fast process.  I let the update run for four hours over the course of an afternoon.  After it applied the update the build number came up as LCA44B.  Based on the [Android Version History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history) and the [Android Codenames, Tags, and Build Numbers](http://source.android.com/source/build-numbers.html) the watch went from KitKat to Lollipop.

Most importantly I can now pair the watch using Android Wear on my iPhone!
